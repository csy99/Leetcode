     * This video is super clear and helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSBLe8cKu0s
     * Algorithm:
     * First observation: all the points in the final result come from the four angles that each building has
     * Scan through the horizontal lines
     * Use a PriorityQueue to hold each building, and make the PriorityQueue to sort on the height of the buildings
     * whenever we encounter the start of a building, we push it into the PriorityQueue, whenever we finished scanning that building, we remove it from the PriorityQueue
     * Also, in the scan process, we’ll keep updating the maxHeight in the PriorityQueue if we find a new maxHeight which means the building will be overshadowed by the new higher one
     * <p>
     * Three edge cases (see the graph illustration in the above video at 12’18”):
     * when two buildings have the same start point, the one with higher height shows up in the final result
     * when two buildings have the same end point, the one with higher height shows up in the final result
     * when the start point of one building is is also the end point of another building, the one with higher height shows up in the final result
     * <p>
     * We use TreeMap over a normal PriorityQueue:
     * For the sake of efficiency (better time complexity), we’ll use TreeMap which supports O(logn) for remove() operation, this is the reason we choose TreeMap over a normal PriorityQueue in Java (PriorityQueue supports add() and getMaxVal() in both O(logn) time, however, for remove(), it does NOT.)
     * But TreeMap in Java supports all the three operations in O(logn) time.
